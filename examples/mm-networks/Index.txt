Index of numbered example scenarios, mainly derived from imported MM networks. Used for testing Freeway.

Unless otherwise stated these scenarios are valid and should work for simulation or estimation. Some scenarios may be deliberately invalid for the purposes of testing failure behaviours.


28:
MM network 28 (cid = 1) from mmlivedb1

28000001:
Modified version of MM network 28 (cid = 1) from mmlivedb1 with some missing split ratios at junctions, to test automatic allocation matrix code in Freeway.

179:
MM network 179 (cid = 1) from mmlivedb1

181:
MM network 181 (cid = 1) from mmlivedb1

183:
MM network 183 (cid = 1) from mmlivedb1

249:
MM network 249 (cid = 1) from mmlivedb1

335:
